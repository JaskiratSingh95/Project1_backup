my Role in this project was to find out :
Does Race, General Health, Physical health play role for heart disease?

the data was located in Resources folder heart_2020_cleaned.csv

1, as the data was already cleaned, just planed to use the following columns
•	HeartDisease
•	Race
•	PhysicalHealth
•	GenHealth



2, Tried to calculate
•	Race vs HeartDisease
•	physicalHealth vs HeartDisease
•	GenHealth vs Heart disease

Link for coding from the original CDC data form for Physical Health variable and General Health
https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2020/pdf/codebook20_llcp-v2-508.pdf

3, The result was showing bias because some populations were under represented inoverall sample.  the data was not collected equally 
	So for each total race , physicalHealth, GenHealth tried to calculate the average of each Heartdisease=yes / Total



4, for each (Race , PhysicalHealth, GenHealth) created suitable chart 



5, for each (Race , PhysicalHealth, GenHealth) calculated summary stastics
	That means (Total cases, mean, Median, std)
    


At the end I declared my analysis and coming back to the main question:

DOES RACE , PHYSICAL HEALTH, GENERAL HEALTH PLAYS ROLE FOR HAVING HEART DISEASE:

MY answer is:
		According to the data group of races we can canclude American Indian/Alaskan Native sample has 10% heart diseases which is the highest.
		(but the population sample is not large enough to verify)

		and Asians 3.3% of the group has heart disease which is the lowest %.

for physical Health analysis we can definitly say that heart disease can be affected by physical health, 
the more you are fit the less u will be affected by heart disease
also general health plays role on heart disease
