My part of the Project1 was find out if lifetyle plays a factor in heart disease:
Does Smoking, and Dringking alcohol play a factor in heart disease?


The data was located in Resources folder heart_2020_cleaned.csv 


1. As the data was already cleaned, I selected the following variables to answer the above question
•	HeartDisease
•	Smoking
•	Dringking alcohol



2.Calculated the total number of:
•	Smokers vs Heart Disease

Smoking and Heart Disease
3. Plotted a pie chart for Smokers who had heart disease, Smokers who had no heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease

4.Smokers with heart disease were twice as high as non smokers with heart disease

Alcohol Drinking and Heart Disease
Calculated the total number of alcohol consumers vs heart disease
6.Plotted a Bar chart. Each Bar represents a specific category defined by the combination of alcohol drinking and heart disease status. (i.e. Alcohol drinkers who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had no heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease)

7.The visualization helped me understand the distribution of individuals in different groups and provides the relationship between Alcohol drinking and heart disease

Conclusion
Smoking and Alcohol Drinking contribute to heart disease.  

Smoking: from the data, the majority are non smokers out of which a small portion have heart disease. Smokers were at higher risk of heart

Alcohol Drinking: The majority are alcohol drinkers out of which a small portion have a heart disease. Alcohol drinkers are at a higher risk of developing heart disease.

It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to decrease the chances of suffering from heart disease. It is also important for people with heart disease to reduce their smoking and alcohol consumption
